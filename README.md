## Project Overview

This project focuses on addressing the problem of fraud detection in online marketplaces, such as e-commerce platforms or peer-to-peer marketplaces, using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By modeling and analyzing complex transaction networks with GNNs, the aim is to identify fraudulent activities more effectively compared to traditional machine learning approaches.

## Skills and Technologies Utilized

- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
- Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- Anomaly Detection
- Network Analysis
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning

## Project Objectives

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

- Gather transaction data from an online marketplace, including user interactions, purchase history, reviews, etc.
- Transform the data into a graph structure where nodes represent users or products, and edges represent interactions or transactions.

### Graph Neural Network Model

- Develop a GNN-based model capable of effectively capturing the relationships and dependencies within the transaction graph.
- Train the GNN to learn node embeddings that encode user and product behaviors.
