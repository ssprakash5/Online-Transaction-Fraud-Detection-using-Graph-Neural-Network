Project Title: Fraud Detection in Online Marketplaces with Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
Project Overview: In this project, you will tackle the problem of fraud detection in online marketplaces, such as e-commerce platforms or peer-to-peer marketplaces. Instead of traditional machine learning, you will employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model and analyze complex transaction networks, allowing you to identify fraudulent activities more effectively.
Skills and Technologies Utilized:
•	Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
•	Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
•	Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
•	Anomaly Detection
•	Network Analysis
•	Machine Learning
•	Deep Learning
Project Objectives:
1.	Data Collection and Preprocessing:
•	Gather transaction data from an online marketplace, including user interactions, purchase history, reviews, and more.
•	Transform the data into a graph structure where nodes represent users or products, and edges represent interactions or transactions.
2.	Graph Neural Network Model:
•	Develop a GNN-based model that can effectively capture the relationships and dependencies within the transaction graph.
•	Train the GNN to learn node embeddings that encode user and product behaviors.
3.	Anomaly Detection:
•	Implement anomaly detection techniques to identify suspicious or fraudulent activities within the transaction graph.
•	Utilize the learned embeddings to detect anomalies and flag potentially fraudulent transactions or users.
4.	Model Evaluation:
•	Evaluate the GNN-based fraud detection model using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
•	Test the model on a real-world dataset to assess its performance in detecting fraudulent activities.

Expected Outcomes:
•	A robust fraud detection system that leverages GNNs to analyze complex transaction networks.
•	Evaluation results showcasing the model's effectiveness in identifying fraudulent activities.
•	Optionally, an interactive visualization tool for fraud analysts.

Impact:
•	Enhanced security and trust in online marketplaces by proactively identifying and preventing fraudulent transactions.
•	Improved customer satisfaction and reduced financial losses for e-commerce platforms.
•	Demonstrates expertise in graph neural networks and anomaly detection, skills highly relevant in various domains, including finance, social networks, and more.
